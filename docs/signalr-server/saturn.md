# SignalR with Saturn

The use of Saturn computation expressions makes
setting up a SignalR hub quite painless.

## Setting up a basic hub

To get started with the core functionality of SignalR
you only need to take a few steps.

### Define your domain

Firstly you will want to created a *shared* project that will
contain your shared message data structure.

For example:

```fsharp
namespace SignalRApp

module SignalRHub =
    [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
    type Action =
        | IncrementCount of int
        | DecrementCount of int

    [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
    type Response =
        | NewCount of int

module Endpoints =   
    let [<Literal>] Root = "/SignalR"
```

### Handler functions

Once you have a shared model, it's fine to define how your
hub will behave.

There are two functions you will always need to provide when
creating a hub:
* invoke - A function that takes a client message (`Action`) and outputs the server response.
* send - A function that given a client message (`Action`) and hub context and (maybe) responds 
(with a `Response`).

Following our example these would look like this:

```fsharp
module SignalRHub =
    open Fable.SignalR
    open FSharp.Control.Tasks.V2
    open SignalRHub

    let update (msg: Action) =
        match msg with
        | Action.IncrementCount i -> Response.NewCount(i + 1)
        | Action.DecrementCount i -> Response.NewCount(i - 1)

    let invoke (msg: Action) (hubContext: FableHub) =
        task { return update msg }

    let send (msg: Action) (hubContext: FableHub<Action,Response>) =
        update msg
        |> hubContext.Clients.Caller.Send
```

### Adding it to the application

Now that you have a shared model and defined the behavior of your hub, all
that's left is to insert it into the Saturn pipeline.

<Note type="tip">For more information on the CE options see [here](api#configure_signalr)</Note>

<Note type="warning">If your functions have the same name as the custom operations make sure they
are fully qualified, otherwise the CE scope will shadow them and you will get a compiler error.</Note>

```fsharp
application {
    use_signalr (
        configure_signalr {
            endpoint Endpoints.Root
            send SignalRHub.send
            invoke SignalRHub.invoke
        }
    )
    ...
}
```

That's it! You can now call your hub from the Fable client.

## Adding streaming

Similar to above, adding streaming is as easy as extending the steps we've
already done.

### Extend your domain

We need to add the new behavior in our shared model:

```fsharp
module SignalRHub =
    [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
    type Action =
        | IncrementCount of int
        | DecrementCount of int

    [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
    type Response =
        | NewCount of int

    // Streaming from the server
    module StreamFrom =
        [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
        type Action =
            | GenInts
        
        [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
        type Response =
            | GetInts of int

    // Streaming to the server
    module StreamTo =
        [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
        type Action =
            | GiveInt of int

module Endpoints =   
    let [<Literal>] Root = "/SignalR"
```

### Add stream handler functions

If you want to support streaming either from the client and/or the
server you need to define the behavior you want:
* Streaming from - A function that takes a streaming message (`StreamFrom.Action`) , hub context, and a `CancellationToken` that signals that the stream should stop,  that then returns an `IAsyncEnumerable<StreamFrom.Response>`.
* Streaming to - A function that takes a `IAsyncEnumerable<StreamTo.Action>` and a hub context
and then (maybe) responds (with a `Response`).

Following our example the module would now look like this:

<Note type="tip">This is using the [FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq) library</Note>

```fsharp
module SignalRHub =
    open Fable.SignalR
    open FSharp.Control
    open FSharp.Control.Tasks.V2
    open SignalRHub
    open System.Collections.Generic
    open System.Threading

    let update (msg: Action) =
        match msg with
        | Action.IncrementCount i -> Response.NewCount(i + 1)
        | Action.DecrementCount i -> Response.NewCount(i - 1)

    let invoke (msg: Action) (hubContext: FableHub) =
        task { return update msg }

    let send (msg: Action) (hubContext: FableHub<Action,Response>) =
        update msg
        |> hubContext.Clients.Caller.Send

    [<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
    module Stream =
        let sendToClient (msg: StreamFrom.Action) (hubContext: FableHub<Action,Response>) (cancellationToken: CancellationToken) =
            match msg with
            | StreamFrom.Action.GenInts ->
                asyncSeq {
                    for i in [ 1 .. 100 ] do
                        yield StreamFrom.Response.GetInts i
                }
                |> AsyncSeq.toAsyncEnum

        let getFromClient (clientStream: IAsyncEnumerable<StreamTo.Action>) 
            (hubContext: FableHub<Action,Response>) =
            
            AsyncSeq.ofAsyncEnum clientStream
            |> AsyncSeq.iterAsync (function 
                | StreamTo.Action.GiveInt i -> 
                    hubContext.Clients.Caller.Send(Response.NewCount i) 
                    |> Async.AwaitTask)
            |> Async.StartAsTask
```

### Adding it to the application

Now that we've extended our model and defined our behavior we just
add a couple new operations and we're good to go!

```fsharp
application {
    use_signalr (
        configure_signalr {
            endpoint Endpoints.Root
            send SignalRHub.send
            invoke SignalRHub.invoke
            stream_from SignalRHub.Stream.sendToClient
            stream_to SignalRHub.Stream.getFromClient
        }
    )
    ...
}
```
